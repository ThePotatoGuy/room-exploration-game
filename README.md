# Room exploring game

REQUIRES VISUAL STUDIO 2011 to run

Game premise:

You are in a world with endless floors. Each floor consists of randomly generated rooms. Some rooms of stairs to go up or down a floor. 
Some rooms have a key. Some rooms have a dark portal that needs to be locked. Drop 3 keys in each unlocked room to lock it and gain points.

Gain as much points as you can before you get tired or the random generation prevents you from accessing more floors.

Your scores are saved in the players file, but the floor layouts are not. Expect a new layout every game.

Run main.cpp to run.

Instructions are given in game.
